# Reyes-94870-Final
This will be a clear visualization of some of the data collected by the 2018 meta analysis Associations between sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative studies. The goal is to show the negative effects of criminalization of sex work and to inspire the reader to support sex worker safety.

# Data 
The data I will be using comes from the 2018 meta-analysis "Associations between sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative studies" by Lucy Platt, Pippa Grenfell, Rebecca Meiksin, Jocelyn Elmes, Data curation, Susan G. Sherman, Teela Sanders, Peninah Mwangi, Anna-Louise Crago, and Alexander C. Tsai. I will be pluggind thier data into Tablue and Florish using the same spreadsheet they used for thier meta analysis, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289426/bin/pmed.1002680.s007.xlsx">which can be found here</a>. I will also be paraphrasing information in thier summary of the qualitative data for my chart about diffrent models of sex work criminalization. I will be using many of thier same deffinition for sexwork, repressive policeing, and legislative models for the sake of being honest and not miscunstuding thier data. These definitions will be specified in the final project. All of this information is open to the public and  permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

# Part 2
# Intended Audinece 

The intended audience for this project is people unfamiliar with sex work (primarily in Pittsburgh). I felt that many people who are unfamilar with the realities of sex work do not understand what criminalization truely means for sex workers. The first three slides are just deticated to a basic education on sex work as well as adressing some miss conceptions (sex workers work against thier will, sex work only means selling sex, ect.). I felt that adressing these ideas first would make the audience more receptive to the data that was collected. Some of the most important data was qualatative from interviews which I felt people would be unsympathetic to without more of a primer.

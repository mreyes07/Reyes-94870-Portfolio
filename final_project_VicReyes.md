# Reyes-94870-Final
This will be a clear visualization of some of the data collected by the 2018 meta analysis Associations between sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative studies. The goal is to show the negative effects of criminalization of sex work and to inspire the reader to support sex worker safety.

# Data 
The data I will be using comes from the 2018 meta-analysis "Associations between sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative studies" by Lucy Platt, Pippa Grenfell, Rebecca Meiksin, Jocelyn Elmes, Data curation, Susan G. Sherman, Teela Sanders, Peninah Mwangi, Anna-Louise Crago, and Alexander C. Tsai. I will be pluggind thier data into Tablue and Florish using the same spreadsheet they used for thier meta analysis, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289426/bin/pmed.1002680.s007.xlsx">which can be found here</a>. I will also be paraphrasing information in thier summary of the qualitative data for my chart about diffrent models of sex work criminalization. I will be using many of thier same deffinition for sexwork, repressive policeing, and legislative models for the sake of being honest and not miscunstuding thier data. These definitions will be specified in the final project. All of this information is open to the public and  permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

# Part 2
# Intended Audinece 

The intended audience for this project is people unfamiliar with sex work (primarily in Pittsburgh). I felt that many people who are unfamilar with the realities of sex work do not understand what criminalization truely means for sex workers. The first three slides are just deticated to a basic education on sex work as well as adressing some miss conceptions (sex workers work against thier will, sex work only means selling sex, ect.). I felt that adressing these ideas first would make the audience more receptive to the data that was collected. Some of the most important data was qualatative from interviews which I felt people would be unsympathetic to without more of a primer. 
<br>
<br>
Most of my feedback I recived serrounded the language used for the visualizations rather then the visualizations themselves. I used sex worker first language in atempts to humanize the issue, as well as atemted to use clear and specific termonology. Additionally, I included clarification between sex work and full serivice sex work as well as gave the spefic definition for what the study defined as "repressive policeing". 

# Design Decisions
I put a lot of thought into the asthetics of this project. Colors carry a lot of symbolism for topics such as this, so I only used color scheems that I saw used thoughout diffrent orginizations and on various websites and pamphlets. I did not end up using the symbolism of the ubrella because I felt that describing the symbol would just be distracting from the main point. I used illustrations from the public canva commons that would comunicate that sex workers are of multipl genders, races, and ages. This was in attempt to combate the image of sex workers being just young women. I included many links to where people coluld find more information becasue this is far from a comprehensive enducation on sex work and is more of a jumping off point to get people curious.
<br>
<br>
For the graph explaining the qualitative information I wanted to give a quick snap shot into what it's like for a sex worker to live under each level of criminalization. I used the grey gradient to comunicate the decend into less harsh criminalization laws. I originally used Canva for this graph but, becasue of Canva's lack of an embed feature meant I had to export it as a pdf and that made it not readable by screen readers. I asked my very patient boyfreind to show me how to code the same graph in HTML so that it would be more acessable.
<br>
<br>
For the quatitative data, there where quite a few ways I tested out portraying this data, the final pictogram was the one people where most repsonsive to when showing people the diffrent graphs. Users perticularly liked how it emphisized that this has an effect on indeviduals as well as a whole population. I wish I could have included a base state for the qualitative data but it was not available in the spreadsheet used for the study and I did not want to take data from a diffrent study as I felt it would be dishonest to frankenstien data together. I emailed the authors of the study to ask them about this but I did not hear a reply.

# What I've Learned 
One of the biggest things I learned is how messy data is when you find it in the wild. The data base was made to be put in R so it was rough trying to translate this into any visualization software that wasn't R. However, I think the pictogrpahic method ended up working well. I was also surprised to see people's engaugement with the topic of sex work. When testing slides I started off with bare minamum becasue I was doubtful of how long I would keep people's attention. However, people wanted more information instead of less and where curious to know more about the topic.

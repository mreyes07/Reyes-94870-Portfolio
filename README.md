Victoriano Reye's Profolio Telling Stories with Data Summer 2020 at Carnegie Mellon University. 

# About Me
My name is Vic, my pronouns are he/him, and I am in the Arts Management Program at Heinz. I previously worked at the Thomas Merton Center doing data management and currently a volunteer with SistersPGH, Covaid.co, and Pittsburgh Mutual Aid doing case management and fundraising. My plans after graduation are to begin working at Allies for Health + Wellbeing, publish comics and video games, and to get a cat. 

# What I Hope To Learn
I don't have much formal teaching on data visualization so I am excited to learn most anything since it is pretty new to me. I mostly hope to learn better design techniques for communicating complex information as well as simple data visualization software techniques.

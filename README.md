# About Me
My name is Vic, my pronouns are he/him, and I am in the Arts Management Program at Heinz. I previously worked at the Thomas Merton Center doing data management. I'm currently a volunteer with SistersPGH, Covaid.co, and Pittsburgh Mutual Aid doing case management and fundraising. My plans after graduation are to begin working at Allies for Health + Wellbeing, publish comics and video games, and to get a cat. 

# What I Hope To Learn
I don't have much formal teaching on data visualization so I am excited to learn most anything since it is pretty new to me. I mostly hope to learn better design techniques for communicating complex information as well as simple data visualization software techniques.

Assignment: Visualizing Government Debt

All these charts use the same data from OECD.org which has the debt-to-GDP ratio of countries all over the world over time. The debt-to-GDP ratio is described on the website as "Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable." Some data is missing for some years inlcuding 2019 in which some has not been collected yet. Despite all charts using the same data, the three charts bellow comunicate diffrent things and have diffrent uses.

As shown in the Visual Vocabulary document from FT graphic, bar graphs comunicate a ranking. In this case the ranking is of countries have the most debt. This chart is the esiest to understand of the three. It gives us a clear line up and uses a simple color palet with enough contrast to clearly see diffrent elements. The list of countries is hard to read because it is slanted and cramped but, the mouse over tabs clear up information so this didn't confuse me too much.

The secound chart is the hardest to read for me. It is a complilation of multiple charts smushed into one. It is useful in giving a picture of the paterns of each countires debt. It is also taking the extra step from the firt graph and comunicating debt overtime. It is hard to get a hold of at fist but, it is comunicating a lot of information and is the best at ephisizing the each indevidual countries debt and probably would be best for predicting the future debt of a country. However, it would be hard to read if you wented to compare countries two eachother for a given year, like done in the first graph.

In my third graph I atempted to make a graph that comunicated the information of the secound graph while also showing a country ranking from year to year. I created a dot graph wich also contains a time lapse. I also added a color gradeint so it would be easier to see changes that where drastic overtime. I was trying to comunicate a lot in this graph. It does not illustrate paterns of indivisual countries over time as the fist one does. However, I think it is successful showing broad shifts in countries while still being able to easlily compare them over the years. It is definalty not as clear as the first graph but, it has the added benifit of showing shifts overtime.

All Gaphs could use some rewoking in terms of labeling and decription. What the Debt-to-GDP and Total % of GDP could be explained or phrased more clearly for the average viewer. The title could also do a better job at illustrating why we are looking at the graph in the first place and why it is important or intresting.
